The Grafcet is a language that allows modeling of automation systems, mainly control systems. Its graphical character, defined with simple rules, becomes attractive for modeling of sequential behaviors and more complex dynamic of systems. This project aims to supply a framework to help the definition of structures and simulation of Grafcet models. In the first stage of the project, it will be defined the representation of the model and basic mechanisms of interpretation. In the second stage the objective will be to supply a visualization layer, that facilitates to the creation and maintenance of models of graphical form. It is also of interest of the project to supply a core of class with small footprint, aiming at the use in embedded systems.
